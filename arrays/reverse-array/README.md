This code reverts a given array for every K length.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

If revert length is greater than actual size of array then revert whole array.

If revert length is fully dividing array length then easy reverse in chunks.

If not dividing completely then revert the rest of array.

For reverting use swapping elements from left and right.
